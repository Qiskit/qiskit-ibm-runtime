    The :class:`qiskit_ibm_runtime.QiskitRuntimeService` ``channel`` can now be stored
    as an environment variable, ``QISKIT_IBM_CHANNEL``. This way, when using Runtime 
    Primitives, the service does not have to be instantiated manually and can instead 
    be created directly from environment variables.
