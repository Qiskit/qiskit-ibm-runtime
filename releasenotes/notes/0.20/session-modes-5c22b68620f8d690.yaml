    Sessions will now be started with a new ``/sessions`` endpoint that allows for different 
    execution modes. Batch mode is now supported through :class:`~qiskit_ibm_runtime.Batch`, and 
    :class:`~qiskit_ibm_runtime.Session` will work the same as way as before. 
    Please see https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/run/sessions for more information.

    Note that ``Session`` and ``Batch`` created from ``qiskit-ibm-runtime`` prior to this release will no longer be 
    supported after March 31, 2024. Please update your ``qiskit-ibm-runtime`` version as soon as possible before this date. 

    Also note that using simulators with sessions is no longer supported. Users can still start 
    sessions with simulators without any issues but a session will not actually be created. There will be no session ID.
