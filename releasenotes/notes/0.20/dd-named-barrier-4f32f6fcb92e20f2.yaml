    Add ``dd_barrier`` optional input to :class:`.PadDynamicalDecoupling` 
    constructor to identify portions of the circuit to apply dynamical 
    decoupling (dd) on selectively. If this string is contained in the label of 
    a barrier in the circuit, dd is applied on the delays ending with it (on 
    the same qubits); otherwise, it is not applied.
