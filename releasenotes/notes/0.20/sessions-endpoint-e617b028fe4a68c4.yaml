    Sessions started with :meth:`qiskit_ibm_runtime.IBMBackend.open_session` will use the 
    new ``/sessions`` endpoint. 

    The sessions functionality will not change but note that ``backend.run()`` sessions 
    prior to this release will no longer be supported after March 31, 2024. 
    Please update your ``qiskit-ibm-runtime`` version as soon as possible before this date.
