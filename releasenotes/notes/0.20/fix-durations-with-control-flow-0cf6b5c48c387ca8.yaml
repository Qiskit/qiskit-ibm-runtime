fixes:
  - |
    Fix assignment of instruction durations when scheduling circuits with   
    control flow. Prior to this fix, the indices for instructions on inner 
    blocks were not mapped to the physical indices in the outer dag.
other:
  - |
    The :class:`~InstructionDurations` `durations` input is now also required 
    for the constructor of :class:`~PadDelay`.
