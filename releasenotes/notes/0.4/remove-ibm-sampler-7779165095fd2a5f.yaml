    :class:`~qiskit_ibm_runtime.IBMSampler` class is now deprecated and removed
    with this `remove-ibm-sampler` release. Use
    :class:`~qiskit_ibm_runtime.Sampler` class going forward.

    Example:

    Before::

      from qiskit_ibm_runtime import IBMRuntimeService, IBMSampler
      service = IBMRuntimeService(channel="ibm_cloud", token="...", instance="...")

      sampler_factory = IBMSampler(service=service, backend="ibmq_qasm_simulator")

      with sampler_factory(circuits=[qc], parameters="...") as sampler:
          result = sampler(circuit_indices=[0], ...)

    After::

      from qiskit_ibm_runtime import QiskitRuntimeService, Sampler
      service = QiskitRuntimeService(channel="ibm_cloud", token="...", instance="...")

      with Sampler(
        circuits=[qc],
        parameters="...",
        service=service,
        options={ "backend": "ibmq_qasm_simulator" },  # or IBMBackend<"ibmq_qasm_simulator">
      ) as sampler:
          result = sampler(circuit_indices=[0], ...)
