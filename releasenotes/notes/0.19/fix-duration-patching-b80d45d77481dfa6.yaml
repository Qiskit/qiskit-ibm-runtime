fixes:
  - |
    Fix the patching of :class:`.DynamicCircuitInstructions` for instructions
    with durations that are not in units of ``dt``. 
upgrade:
  - |
    Extend :meth:`.DynamicCircuitInstructions.from_backend` to extract and 
    patch durations from both :class:`.BackendV1` and :class:`.BackendV2`
    objects. Also add :meth:`.DynamicCircuitInstructions.from_target` to use a
    :class:`.Target` object instead.
