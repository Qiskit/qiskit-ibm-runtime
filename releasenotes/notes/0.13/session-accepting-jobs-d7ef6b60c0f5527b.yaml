    :meth:`qiskit_ibm_runtime.Session.close` has been updated to mark a ``Session`` as no longer
    accepting new jobs. The session won't accept more jobs but it will continue to run any 
    queued jobs until they are done or the max time expires. This will also happen
    automatically when the session context manager is exited. When a session that is not accepting 
    jobs has run out of jobs to run, it's immediately closed, freeing up the backend to run more jobs rather 
    than wait for the interactive timeout.

    The old close method behavior has been moved to a new method, 
    :meth:`qiskit_ibm_runtime.Session.cancel`, where all queued jobs within a session are 
    cancelled and terminated.
