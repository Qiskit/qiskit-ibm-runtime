    The ``name`` parameter has been added to 
    :meth:`qiskit_ibm_runtime.IBMRuntimeService.programs` and 
    :meth:`qiskit_ibm_runtime.IBMRuntimeService.pprint_programs`
    which can be used to filter by a specific program name. The
    ``name`` given must be an exact match with an actual program name.
