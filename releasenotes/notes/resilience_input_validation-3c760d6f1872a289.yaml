    Added validation checking for options given as input to ``resilience``.
    Previously, this validation was done on the server side. By adding them
    on the client side, response will be much faster upon failure.
    The environment variable ``QISKIT_RUNTIME_REMOVE_OPTIONS_VALIDATION``
    is used to control validation. If set, validation will be skipped.
