    Support input of type ``CouplingMap`` when given as simulator option.
    Previously we supported, for example::
    
      options.simulator = {"coupling_map": [[0, 1], [1, 0]]}
    
    Now we also support the following::
    
      options.simulator = {"coupling_map": CouplingMap.from_line(10)}
