    A new local testing mode is added. It allows you to
    validate your quantum prorams before sending them to a physical system.
    The local testing mode is activated if one of the fake
    backends in ``qiskit_ibm_runtime.fake_provider`` or a Qiskit Aer backend
    instance is used when instantiating a primitive or a session.
