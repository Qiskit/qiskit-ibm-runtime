    A ``rep_delay`` parameter has been added to the
    :class:`~qiskit_ibm_runtime.options.ExecutionOptions`.
    This parameter is used to denote the the delay between a measurement and
    the subsequent quantum circuit.
    This is only supported on backends that have
    ``backend.configuration().dynamic_reprate_enabled=True``. It must be from the
    range supplied by ``backend.configuration().rep_delay_range``.
    Default is given by ``backend.configuration().default_rep_delay``.
