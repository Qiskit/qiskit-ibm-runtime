    If a job is returned without a backend, retrieving the backend through 
    :meth:`qiskit_ibm_runtime.RuntimeJob.backend` will re-retrieve data from 
    the server and attempt to update the backend. Additionally, ``job_id`` and ``backend``, 
    which were deprecated attributes of :class:`qiskit_ibm_runtime.RuntimeJob` have now
    been removed.
