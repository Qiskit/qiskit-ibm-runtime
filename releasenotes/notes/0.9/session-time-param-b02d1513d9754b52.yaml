    Added a new argument called ``session_time`` to the program_run method and 
    :class:`qiskit_ibm_runtime.RuntimeOptions`. Now values entered by the user for session ``max_time`` 
    will be sent to the server side as ``session_time``. This allows users to specify different values 
    for session ``max_time`` and ``max_execution_time``.
