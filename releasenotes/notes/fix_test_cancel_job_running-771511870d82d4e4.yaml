    Fixes a race condition in the function `test_cancel_running_job()` in `test_job()`. 
    Modified the `cancel()` method in `runtime_job.py` to handle status 204 as case 
    where job cancellation cannot be performed due to specific conditions.  
    Refer to #1019 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-ibm-runtime/issues/1019>_ for
    more details.
