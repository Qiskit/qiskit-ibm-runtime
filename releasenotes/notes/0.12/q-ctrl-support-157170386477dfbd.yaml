    There is a new parameter, ``channel_strategy`` that can be set in the initialization of 
    :class:`qiskit_ibm_runtime.QiskitRuntimeService` or saved in 
    :meth:`qiskit_ibm_runtime.QiskitRuntimeService.save_account`. If ``channel_strategy`` 
    is set to ``q-ctrl``, all jobs within the service will use
    the Q-CTRL error mitigation strategy.
