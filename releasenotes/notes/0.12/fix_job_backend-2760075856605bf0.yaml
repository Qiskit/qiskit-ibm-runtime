    When running on channel "ibm_cloud", it is possible not to specify
    the backend. In this case, the system selects one of the available
    backends for this service. Issue 
    `#625 https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-ibm-runtime/issues/625`
    reported that the the backend returned by ``job.backend()`` was not
    always the actual backend on which the job was run. This PR fixes
    this bug.
