    Added a ``global_service``, so that if the user defines a `QiskitRuntimeService`, it will
    be used by the primitives, even if the service is not passed to them explicitly.
    For example::
    
      from qiskit_ibm_runtime import QiskitRuntimeService, Sampler
      service = QiskitRuntimeService(channel="ibm_quantum")
      # Sampler._service field will be initialized to ``service``
      sampler = Sampler(backend="ibmq_qasm_simulator")
