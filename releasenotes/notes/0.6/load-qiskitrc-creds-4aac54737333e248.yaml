    When migrating from ``qiskit-ibmq-provider`` your ``ibm_quantum`` channel credentials
    will get automatically copied over from the qiskitrc file
    and a qiskit-ibm.json file will get created if one doesn't exist.
    You have to just initialize :class:`~qiskit_ibm_runtime.QiskitRuntimeService` class without
    passing any parameters to use this copied over default ``ibm_quantum`` account.

    Ex::

      from qiskit_ibm_runtime import QiskitRuntimeService
      service = QiskitRuntimeService()
