    When a single backend is retrieved with the ``instance`` parameter, 

    .. code-block::

        service.backend('ibm_torino', instance='ibm-q/open/main')
        # raises error if torino is not in ibm-q/open/main but in a different instance
        # the user has access to
        service = QiskitRuntimeService(channel="ibm_quantum", instance="ibm-q/open/main")
        service.backend('ibm_torino') # raises the same error

    if the backend is not in the instance but in a different one the user has access to, an error 
    will be raised. The same error will now be raised if an instance is passed in at initialization
    and then a backend not in that instance is retrieved.
