    Circuits that do not match the target hardware definition are no longer
    supported by Qiskit Runtime primitives, unless ``channel_strategy="q-ctrl"``
    is used. See the transpilation documentation
    (https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/transpile) for instructions to transform
    circuits and the primitive examples
    (https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/run/primitives-examples) to see
    this coupled with operator transformations.
