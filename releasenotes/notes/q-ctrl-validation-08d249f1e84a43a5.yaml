    The Sampler and Estimator primitives have been enhanced to incorporate custom validation procedures when 
    the channel_strategy property within the :class:qiskit_ibm_runtime.QiskitRuntimeService is configured as "q-ctrl." 
    This customized validation logic effectively rectifies incorrect input options and safeguards users against 
    inadvertently disabling Q-CTRL's performance enhancements.
