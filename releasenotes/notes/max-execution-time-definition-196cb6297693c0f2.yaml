    The `max_execution_time` option is now based on quantum time instead of wall clock time. 
    Quantum time is the time that the QPU complex 
    (including control software, control electronics, QPU, and so on) 
    is engaged in processing the job. If a job exceeds this time limit, it is forcibly cancelled.
    Simulator jobs continue to use wall clock time because they do not have quantum time.
