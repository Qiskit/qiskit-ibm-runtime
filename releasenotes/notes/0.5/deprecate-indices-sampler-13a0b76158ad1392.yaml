upgrade:
  - |
    The parameters ``circuit_indices`` and ``observable_indices`` when calling ``estimator``
    are now deprecated and will be removed in a future release.
    You can now pass either indices or objects using the ``circuits`` and ``observables`` parameters.

    Ex::
    
        with Sampler(
          circuits=[qc1, qc2],
          service=service,
          options=options
        ) as sampler:
          # pass circuits as indices
          result = sampler(circuits=[0, 1], parameter_values=[theta1, theta2])

          # pass circuit as objects
          result = sampler(circuits=[qc1, qc2], parameter_values=[theta2, theta3])
