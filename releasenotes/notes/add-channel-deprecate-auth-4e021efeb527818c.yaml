upgrade:
  - |
    A new parameter ``channel`` has now been added to :class:`qiskit_ibm_runtime.IBMRuntimeService`
    class and also to methods like :meth:`~qiskit_ibm_runtime.IBMRuntimeService.save_account`,
    :meth:`~qiskit_ibm_runtime.IBMRuntimeService.saved_accounts` and
    :meth:`~qiskit_ibm_runtime.IBMRuntimeService.delete_account`. It can be set to ``ibm_quantum``
    or ``ibm_cloud`` to authenticate to either of the two different channels through which
    Qiskit Runtime service is currently offered. ``channel`` replaces the ``auth`` parameter which
    has now been deprecated.

    The ``auth`` parameter to :class:`qiskit_ibm_runtime.IBMRuntimeService` class
    and also to methods like :meth:`~qiskit_ibm_runtime.IBMRuntimeService.save_account`,
    :meth:`~qiskit_ibm_runtime.IBMRuntimeService.saved_accounts` and
    :meth:`~qiskit_ibm_runtime.IBMRuntimeService.delete_account` has now been deprecated
    and will be removed in a future release. Please use the new ``channel`` parameter instead.
