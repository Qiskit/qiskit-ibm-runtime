    You can now set the ``IBM Cloud service name`` as a value for the account ``instance`` 
    parameter. If you choose to set the name instead of the ``CRN``, the initialization time of the
    :class:`qiskit_ibm_runtime.IBMRuntimeService``` class is slightly higher because the required ``CRN``
    value is internally resolved via IBM Cloud APIs.
