    This release add a version 2 of the primitives -
    :class:`~qiskit_ibm_runtime.SamplerV2` and
    :class:`~qiskit_ibm_runtime.EstimatorV2`.
    The emphasis of this new version is on performing vectorized calls to the
    primitive ``run()`` methods, so that sweeps over parameter value sets and
    observables can be efficiently specified.  The sampler has also been
    changed to return the outputs (e.g. bitstrings) from every shot,
    rather than providing a counts-like return.
    See the
    `Migration Guide <https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/api/migration-guides/v2-primitives>`_
    for more details on the changes and migration steps.
