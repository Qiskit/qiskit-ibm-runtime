    `qiskit-ibm-runtime` is a new Python API client for accessing the quantum programs,
    systems and simulators at IBM Quantum via the Qiskit Runtime Service.


    This new package is built upon the work already done in `qiskit.providers.ibmq.runtime`
    module in the `qiskit-ibmq-provider` package and replaces it going forward. The `runtime`
    module in `qiskit-ibmq-provider` package is now deprecated.


    `qiskit-ibm-runtime` is not included as part of `Qiskit` meta package and thereby you have to
    install it separately using ``pip install qiskit-ibm-runtime``.
