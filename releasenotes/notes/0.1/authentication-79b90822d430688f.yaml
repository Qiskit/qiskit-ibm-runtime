    Qiskit Runtime service is accessible using an IBM Quantum (`legacy`) account
    or an IBM Cloud (`cloud`) account.
    `qiskit-ibm-runtime` enables you to connect to either of these accounts::

      # Legacy
      from qiskit_ibm_runtime import IBMRuntimeService
      service = IBMRuntimeService(auth="legacy", token="abc")

      # Cloud
      from qiskit_ibm_runtime import IBMRuntimeService
      service = IBMRuntimeService(auth="cloud", token="abc", instance="IBM Cloud CRN or Service instance name")
