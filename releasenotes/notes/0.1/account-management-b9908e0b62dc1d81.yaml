    `qiskit-ibm-runtime` package no longer uses the `$HOME/.qiskit/qiskitrc` file used by
    `qiskit-ibmq-provider` to save credentials. Credentials are now stored in a
    JSON format in `$HOME/.qiskit/qiskit-ibm.json` file when you use
    :meth:`qiskit_ibm_runtime.IBMRuntimeService.save_account` method.

    You can now save multiple credentials and give an optional `name` for each credential.
