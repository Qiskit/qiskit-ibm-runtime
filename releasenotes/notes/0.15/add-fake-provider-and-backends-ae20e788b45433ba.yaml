    A new module :mod:`qiskit_ibm_runtime.fake_provider`, has been added to provide access
    to a series of fake backends derived from snapshots of IBM Quantum devices. This
    functionality was originally provided by the :mod:`qiskit.providers.fake_provider`
    module, but will soon be deprecated in favor of :mod:`qiskit_ibm_runtime.fake_provider`.

    The snapshots provided by the fake backends are useful for local testing of the transpiler
    and performing local noisy simulations of the system before running on real devices.
    Here is an example of using a fake backend for transpilation and simulation::

      from qiskit import QuantumCircuit
      from qiskit import transpile
      from qiskit_ibm_runtime.fake_provider import FakeManilaV2

      # Get a fake backend from the fake provider
      backend = FakeManilaV2()

      # Create a simple circuit
      circuit = QuantumCircuit(3)
      circuit.h(0)
      circuit.cx(0,1)
      circuit.cx(0,2)
      circuit.measure_all()

      # Transpile the ideal circuit to a circuit that can be directly executed by the backend
      transpiled_circuit = transpile(circuit, backend)

      # Run the transpiled circuit using the simulated fake backend
      job = backend.run(transpiled_circuit)
      counts = job.result().get_counts()
