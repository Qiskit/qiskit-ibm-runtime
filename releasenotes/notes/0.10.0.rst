0.10.0
======

New Features
------------

-  Python 3.11 is now supported.

Upgrade Notes
-------------

-  Added error messages in case the user defines unsupported values for
   ‘max_execution_time’. Previously, this validation was done on the
   server side.

Bug Fixes
---------

-  Added deserialization of the params of RuntimeJob.inputs. Previously,
   the circuits were returned in serialized format. Fixes issue
   `#829 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-ibm-runtime/issues/829>`__.

-  Allow for users to retrieve all backends even if one of the backends
   has a missing configuration. The backend without a configuration will
   not be returned.
