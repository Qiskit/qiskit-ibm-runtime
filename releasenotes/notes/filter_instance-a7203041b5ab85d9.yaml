    If ``instance`` is provided as parameter to 
    :class:`qiskit_ibm_runtime.QiskitRuntimeService`,
    then this is used as a filter in :meth:`QiskitRuntimeService.backends()`.
    If ``instance`` is not recognized as one of the provider instances,
    an exception will be raised. Previously, we only issued a warning.
