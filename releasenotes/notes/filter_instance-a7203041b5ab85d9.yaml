    If ''instance'' is provided as parameter to 
    :meth:`QiskitRuntimeService.__init__`,
    then this is used as a filter in :meth:`QiskitRuntimeService.backends()`.
    If ''instance'' is not recognized as one of the provider instances,
    an exception will be raised. Previously, we only issued a warning.
