    "## Simple VQE\n",
    "\n",
    "VQE is an hybrid quantum-classical optimization procedure that finds the lowest eigenstate and eigenenergy of a linear system defined by a given Hamiltonian of Pauli operators.  For example, consider the following two-qubit Hamiltonian:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "H = A X_{1}\\otimes X_{0} + A Y_{1}\\otimes Y_{0} + A Z_{1}\\otimes Z_{0},\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $A$ is numerical coefficient and the subscripts label the qubits on which the operators act.  The zero index being farthest right is the ordering used in Qiskit.  The Pauli operators tell us which measurement basis to to use when measuring each of the qubits.\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to find the ground state (lowest energy state) of this Hamiltonian, and the associated eigenvector.  To do this we must start at a given initial state and iteratively vary the parameters that define this state using a classical optimizer such that the computed energies of subsequent steps are nominally lower than those previously.  The parameterized state of the system is defined by an ansatz quantum circuit that should have non-zero support in the direction of the ground state.  Because in general we do not know the solution, the choice of ansatz circuit can be highly problem specific with a form dictated by additional information. For further information about variational algorithmms, we point the reader to [Nature Reviews Physics volume 3, 625 (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s42254-021-00348-9).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus we need at least the following inputs to create our VQE quantum program:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A representation of the Hamiltonian that specifies the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. A choice of parameterized ansatz circuit, and the ability to pass configuration options, if any.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the following are also beneficial inputs that users might want to have:\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Add the ability to pass an initial state.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Vary the number of shots that are taken.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Ability to select which classical optimizer is used, and set configuraton values, if any. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Ability to turn on and off measurement mitigation.\n"

Thus it is beneficial to keep inputs limited to basic data types and structures unless you have experience with custom object serialization, or they are common Qiskit types such as QuantumCircuit etc.  Fortunately, the VQE program described above can be made out of simple Python components.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, it is possible to represent any Hamiltonian using a list of values with each containing the numerical coefficeint for each term and the string representation for the Pauli operators.  For the above example, the ground state energy with $A=1$ is $-3$ and we can write it as:"

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "We have demonstrated how to create, upload, and use a custom Qiskit Runtime by creating our own VQE solver from scratch.  This tutorial was meant to touch upon every aspect of the process for a real-world example.  Within the current limitations of the Runtime environment, this example should enable readers to develop their own single-file runtime program.  This program is also a good starting off point for exploring addtional flavours of VQE runtime.  For example, it is straightforward to vary the number of shots per iteration, increasing shots as the number of iterations increases.  Those looking to go deeper can consider implimenting an [adaptive VQE](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-10988-2), where the ansatz is not fixed at initialization."
