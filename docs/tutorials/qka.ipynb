    "**Classification with Support Vector Machines**<br>\n",
    "Classification problems are widespread in machine learning applications. Examples include credit card risk, handwriting recognition, and medical diagnosis. One approach to tackling classification problems is the support vector machine (SVM) [1,2]. This supervised learning algorithm uses labeled data samples to train a model that can predict to which class a test sample belongs. It does this by finding a separating hyperplane maximizing the margin between data classes. Often, data is not linearly separable in the original space. In these cases, the kernel trick is used to implicitly encode a transformation of the data into a higher-dimensional feature space, through the inner product between pairs of data points, where the data may become separable.\n",

    "**Quantum Kernels**<br>\n",
    "Quantum computers can be used to encode classical data in a quantum-enhanced feature space. In 2019, IBM introduced an algorithm called the quantum kernel estimator (QKE) for computing quantum kernels [3]. This algorithm uses quantum circuits with data provided classically and offers an efficient way to evaluate inner products between data in a quantum feature space. For two data samples $\\theta$ and $\\theta'$, the kernel matrix is given as\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $U(\\theta)$ prepares the quantum feature state. Quantum kernels used in a classification framework inherit the convex optimization program of the SVM and avoid common limitations of variational quantum classifiers. A key observation of this paper was that a necessary condition for a computational advantage requires quantum circuits for the kernel that are hard to simulate classically. More recently, IBM proved that quantum kernels can offer superpolynomial speedups over any classical learner on a learning problem based on the hardness of the discrete logarithm problem [4]. This means that quantum kernels can someday offer quantum advantage on suitable problems. \n",

    "**Quantum Kernels that Exploit Structure in Data**<br>\n",
    "An important approach in the search for practical quantum advantage in machine learning is to identify quantum kernels for learning problems that have underlying structure in the data. We've taken a step in this direction in our recent paper [5], where we introduced a broad class of quantum kernels that exploit group structure in data. Examples of learning problems for data with group structure could include learning permutations or classifying translations. We call this new class of kernels _covariant quantum kernels_ as they are related to covariant quantum measurements. The quantum feature map is defined by a unitary representation $D(\\theta)$ of a group $G$ for some element $\\theta \\in G$, and a fiducial reference state $\\lvert\\psi\\rangle = V\\lvert0^n\\rangle$ prepared by a unitary circuit $V$. The kernel matrix is given as\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, the choice of the fiducial state is not known _a priori_ and can significantly impact the performance of the classifier. Here, we use a method called quantum kernel alignment (QKA) to find a good fiducial state for a given group.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Aligning Quantum Kernels on a Dataset**<br>\n",
    "In practice, SVMs require a choice of the kernel function. Sometimes, symmetries in the data can inform this selection, other times it is chosen in an ad hoc manner. Kernel alignment is one approach to learning a kernel on a given dataset by iteratively adapting it to have high similarity to a target kernel informed from the underlying data distribution [6]. As a result, the SVM with an aligned kernel will likely generalize better to new data than with an unaligned kernel. Using this concept, we introduced in [5] an algorithm for quantum kernel alignment, which provides a way to learn a quantum kernel from a family of kernels. Specifically, the algorithm optimizes the parameters in a quantum circuit to maximize the alignment of a kernel while converging to the maximum SVM margin. In the context of covariant quantum kernels, we extend Eq. $(1)$ to\n",

    "**Covariant Quantum Kernels on a Specific Learning Problem**<br>\n",
    "Let's try out QKA on a learning problem. In the following, we'll consider a binary classification problem we call _labeling cosets with error_ [5]. In this problem, we will use a group and a subgroup to form two cosets, which will represent our data classes. We take the group $G = SU(2)^{\\otimes n}$ for $n$ qubits, which is the special unitary group of $2\\times2$ matrices and has wide applicability in nature, for example, the Standard Model of particle physics and in many condensed matter systems. We take the graph-stabilizer subgroup $S_{\\mathrm{graph}} \\in G$ with $S_{\\mathrm{graph}} = \\langle \\{ X_i \\otimes_{k:(k,i) \\in \\mathcal{E}} Z_k \\}_{i \\in \\mathcal{V}} \\rangle$ for a graph $(\\mathcal{E},\\mathcal{V})$ with edges $\\mathcal{E}$ and vertices $\\mathcal{V}$. Note that the stabilizers fix a stabilizer state such that $D_s \\lvert \\psi\\rangle = \\lvert \\psi\\rangle$. This observation will be useful a bit later. \n",
    "\n",
    "To generate the dataset, we write the rotations of the group as $D(\\theta_1, \\theta_2, 0)=\\exp(i \\theta_1 X) \\exp(i \\theta_2 Z) \\in SU(2)$, so that each qubit is parametrized by the first two Euler angles (the third we set to zero). Then, we draw randomly two sets of angles $\\mathbf{\\theta}_\\pm \\in [-\\pi/4, \\pi/4]^{2n}$ for the $n$-qubit problem. From these two sets, we construct a binary classification problem by forming two left-cosets (representing the two classes) with those angles, $C_\\pm = D(\\mathbf{\\theta}_\\pm) S_{\\mathrm{graph}}$ where $D(\\mathbf{\\theta}_\\pm) = \\otimes_{k=1}^n D(\\theta_\\pm^{2k-1}, \\theta_\\pm^{2k}, 0)$. Note that the elements of the cosets can again be written in terms of Euler angles. We build training and testing sets by randomly drawing elements from $C_\\pm$ such that the dataset has samples $i=1,...,m$ containing the first two Euler angles for each qubit $\\mathbf{\\theta}_{y_i} = (\\theta_{y_i}^{1}, \\theta_{y_i}^{2}, \\theta_{y_i}^{3}, \\theta_{y_i}^{4}, ..., \\theta_{y_i}^{2n-1}, \\theta_{y_i}^{2n})$ and labels $y_i \\in \\{-1,1\\}$ that indicate to which coset a sample belongs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we select a fiducial state. A natural candidate is the stabilizer state we encountered above. Why? Because this is a subgroup invariant state, $D_s\\lvert\\psi\\rangle = \\lvert\\psi\\rangle$, which causes the data for a given coset to be mapped to a unique state: $D(\\mathbf{\\theta}_\\pm)D_s \\lvert\\psi\\rangle = D(\\mathbf{\\theta}_\\pm) \\lvert\\psi\\rangle$. This means the classifier only needs to distinguish the _two_ states $D(\\mathbf{\\theta}_\\pm) \\lvert\\psi\\rangle \\langle \\psi\\rvert D^\\dagger(\\mathbf{\\theta}_\\pm)$ for every element of the coset. In this tutorial, we will add a small Gaussian error with variance $0.01$ to the Euler angles of the dataset. This noise will perturb these two states, but if the variance is sufficiently small, we expect the states will still be classified correctly. Let's consider a parametrized version of the stabilizer state, associated with the coupling graph $(\\mathcal{E},\\mathcal{V})$ given by the device connectivity, as our fiducial state and then use kernel alignment to find its optimal parameters. Specifically, we'll replace the initial layers of Hadamards in the graph state with $y$-rotations by an angle $\\lambda$,\n",

    "where $CZ=\\mathrm{diag}(1,1,1,-1)$. Then, given two samples from our dataset, $\\mathbf{\\theta}$ and $\\mathbf{\\theta}'$, the kernel matrix is evaluated as in Eq. $(2)$. If we initialize the kernel with $\\lambda \\approx 0$, we expect the quantum kernel alignment algorithm to converge towards the optimal $\\lambda = \\pi/2$ and the classifier to yield 100\\% test accuracy.\n",

    "**Speeding up Algorithms with Qiskit Runtime**<br>\n",
    "QKA is an iterative quantum-classical algorithm, in which quantum hardware is used to execute parametrized quantum circuits for evaluating the quantum kernel matrices with QKE, while a classical optimizer tunes the parameters of those circuits to maximize the alignment. Iterative algorithms of this type can be slow due to latency between the quantum and classical calculations. Qiskit Runtime is a new architecture that can speed up iterative algorithms like QKA by co-locating classical computations with the quantum hardware executions. In this tutorial, we'll use QKA with Qiskit Runtime to learn a good quantum kernel for the _labeling cosets with error_ problem defined above.\n",

Let's also plot this kernel matrix (we'll subtract off the diagonal to show the contrast between the remaining entries). The kernel matrix is expected to have a block-diagonal structure. This reflects the fact that the kernel maps the input data effectively to just two states (modulo the small noise we added to the data; recall the discussion above). That is, data in the same coset (same class label) have a larger overlap than do data from different cosets."
