    - A combination of pulses on the logical channels is exceeding the hardware output due to internal usage of hardware output.

    - The input pulse had some parameters which were not validated. This can be because certain parameters are expected to be real, while others are complex. It may also be due to the amplitude or duration of the pulse exceeding a limit, or other invalid combinations of parameters (e.g., a Gaussian square pulse with a flat-top width greater than the pulse's total duration).
    - Verify the pulse input parameters.
