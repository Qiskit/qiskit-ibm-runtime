  For some reason, Reno stopped including release notes
  for 0.16+ starting on the stable/0.21 branch. We can get
  things working by using two release-note entries. The
  API conversion in qiskit/documentation will merge these two
  lists together. Refer to
  https://github.com/Qiskit/documentation/issues/978
