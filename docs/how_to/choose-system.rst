Choose a system or simulator
============================

Before you run a job, you can optionally choose a physical quantum
system or a simulator to run on. If you do not specify one, the job is
sent to the least busy device that you have access to. 

..note::
    
    The Standard plan allows access only to physical quantum systems, while the Lite plan allows access only to simulators. 

To find your available systems and simulators, view the `Compute
resources page <https://cloud.ibm.com/quantum/resources>`__. You must be logged in to see your available compute
resources. You can also view your available systems and simulators by using 
`Swagger <https://us-east.quantum-computing.cloud.ibm.com/openapi/#/Programs/list-backends>`__.
