Retrieve job results
=================================

After submitting your job, a `RuntimeJob <https://qiskit.org/documentation/partners/qiskit_ibm_runtime/stubs/qiskit_ibm_runtime.RuntimeJob.html#qiskit_ibm_runtime.RuntimeJob>`_ instance is returned. Use the job instance to check the job status or retrieve the results by calling the appropriate method:

.. list-table:: Job methods

  * - job.result()
    - Review job results immediately after the job completes. Job results are available after the job completes.  Therefore, `job.result()` is a blocking call until the job completes.
  * - job.job_id()
    - Return the ID that uniquely identifies that job. Retrieving the job results at a ltar time requires the job ID. Therefore, it is recommended that you save the IDs of jobs you might want to retrieve later.
  * - job.status()
    - Check the job status.
  * - job = service.job(<job_id>)
    - Retrieve a job you previously submitted. This call requires the job ID.

Jobs are also listed on the Jobs page for your quantum service channel:

* For the IBM Cloud channel, from the IBM Cloud console quantum `Instances page <https://cloud.ibm.com/quantum/instances>`__, click the name of your instance, then click the Jobs tab. To see the status of your job, click the refresh arrow in the upper right corner.
* For the IBM Quantum channel, in IBM Quantum platform, open the `Jobs page <https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/jobs>`__.


Retrieve job results at a later time
************************************

Call `service.job(<job ID>)` to retrieve a job you previously submitted. If you don't have the job ID, or if you want to retrieve multiple jobs at once; including jobs from retired systems, call `service.jobs()` with optional filters instead.  See `QiskitRuntimeService.jobs <https://qiskit.org/documentation/partners/qiskit_ibm_runtime/stubs/qiskit_ibm_runtime.QiskitRuntimeService.jobs.html>`__.

.. note::
  `service.jobs()` returns only Qiskit Runtime jobs. To retrieve other jobs, use `qiskit-ibm-provider <https://qiskit.org/documentation/partners/qiskit_ibm_provider/stubs/qiskit_ibm_provider.IBMBackend.html#qiskit_ibm_provider.IBMBackend>`__ instead.

Example
-------

This example returns the 10 most recent runtime jobs that were run on ``ibmq_qasm_simulator``:

.. code-block:: python

  from qiskit_ibm_runtime import QiskitRuntimeService

  # Initialize the account first.
  service = QiskitRuntimeService()

  service.jobs(backend_name="ibmq_qasm_simulator")
