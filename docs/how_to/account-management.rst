Manage your account
=================================

Qiskit Runtime is available on both IBM Cloud and IBM Quantum Platform. The former requires an IBM Cloud account and the latter requires an IBM Quantum account. If you don't have the necessary account, refer to the appropriate link:

* `Setting up your IBM Cloud account <https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-account-getting-started>`__
* `Access your IBM Quantum account <https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/account>`__

There are several methods for account management. Your account credentials can be saved to disk or used in a session and never saved.

* `save_account()`: Save your account to disk for future use.
* `delete_account()`: Delete the saved account from disk.
* `active_account()`: List the account currently in the session.
* `saved_account()`: List the account stored on disk.
