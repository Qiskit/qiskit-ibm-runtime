Overview
==============

Qiskit Runtime is a quantum computing service and programming model that allows users to
optimize workloads and efficiently execute them on quantum systems at scale. The
programming model extends the existing interface in Qiskit with a set of new primitive
programs.

Key concepts
==============

**Primitives**

Primitives are core functions that provide a simplified interface for defining near-time quantum-classical workloads required to efficiently build and customize applications. The initial release of Qiskit Runtime includes two primitives: Estimator and Sampler. They perform foundational quantum computing tasks and act as an entry point to the Qiskit Runtime service.


**Estimator**

The estimator primitive allows users to efficiently calculate and interpret expectation
values of quantum operators required for many algorithms. Users specify a list of circuits
and observables, then tell the program how to selectively group between the lists to
efficiently evaluate expectation values and variances for a given parameter input.

**Sampler**

This primitive takes a user circuit as an input and generates an error-mitigated
readout of quasiprobabilities. This provides users a way to better evaluate shot results
using error mitigation and enables them to more efficiently evaluate the possibility of
multiple relevant data points in the context of destructive interference.
