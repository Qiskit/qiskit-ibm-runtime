   This is the documentation for the experimental ``executor_preview`` branch of Qiskit Runtime.

   .. warning::

      This is the documentation for a feature that is in beta and might not be stable. Since
      February 2026, the branch containing the feature has been merged, and the documentation on
      this site will not be updated. Instead, the feature will be documented as part of the regular
      `API Reference page <https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/docs/en/api/qiskit-ibm-runtime>`_
      documentation: please refer to it for both documentation on stable features, and for the
      latest documentation for this feature.
