Overview
==============

Qiskit Runtime is a quantum computing service and programming model that allows users to 
optimize workloads and efficiently execute them on quantum systems at scale. The 
programming model extends the existing interface in Qiskit with a set of new primitive 
programs.

Key Concepts
==============

**Primitives**

Primitives are predefined programs that provide a simplified interface for defining 
near-time quantum-classical workloads required to efficiently build and customize 
applications. The initial release of Qiskit Runtime includes two primitives: Estimator 
and Sampler. They perform foundational quantum computing tasks and act as an entry point 
to the Qiskit Runtime service.


**Sampler**

This is a program that takes a user circuit as an input and generates an error-mitigated 
readout of quasiprobabilities. This provides users a way to better evaluate shot results 
using error mitigation and enables them to more efficiently evaluate the possibility of 
multiple relevant data points in the context of destructive interference.


**Estimator**

The estimator primitive allows users to efficiently calculate and interpret expectation 
values of quantum operators required for many algorithms. Users specify a list of circuits 
and observables, then tell the program how to selectively group between the lists to 
efficiently evaluate expectation values and variances for a given parameter input.
