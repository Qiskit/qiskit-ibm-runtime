Guide on algorithm tuning options
=================================

One of the advantages of the primitives is that they abstract away the circuit execution setup so that algorithm developers
can focus on the pure algorithmic components. However, sometimes, to get the most out of an algorithm, you might want
to tune certain primitive options. This section describes some of the common settings you might need.

.. attention::

    This section focuses on Qiskit Runtime primitive :class:`.Options` (imported from ``qiskit_ibm_runtime``). While
    most of the `primitives` interface is common across implementations, most :class:`.Options` are not. Consult the
    corresponding API references for information about the |qiskit.primitives|_ and |qiskit_aer.primitives|_ options.

1. Shots
~~~~~~~~

For some algorithms, setting a specific number of shots is a core part of their routines. Previously, shots could be set during the call to `backend.run()`. For example, ``backend.run(shots=1024)``. Now, that setting is part of the execution
options ("second level option"). This can be done during the primitive setup:

.. code-block:: python

    from qiskit_ibm_runtime import Estimator, Options

    options = Options()
    options.execution.shots = 1024

    estimator = Estimator(session=session, options=options)


If you need to modify the number of shots set between iterations (primitive calls), you can set the
shots directly in the ``run()`` method. This overwrites the initial ``shots`` setting.

.. code-block:: python

    from qiskit_ibm_runtime import Estimator

    estimator = Estimator(session=session)

    estimator.run(circuits=circuits, observables=observables, shots=50)

    # other logic

    estimator.run(circuits=circuits, observables=observables, shots=100)

For more information about the primitive options, refer to the 
`Options class API reference <https://qiskit.org/documentation/partners/qiskit_ibm_runtime/stubs/qiskit_ibm_runtime.options.Options.html#qiskit_ibm_runtime.options.Options>`_.


2. Transpilation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, the Qiskit Runtime primitives perform circuit transpilation. There are several optimization
levels you can choose from. These levels affect the transpilation strategy and might include additional error
suppression mechanisms. Level 0 only involves basic transpilation.
To learn about each optimization level, view the Optimization level table in the 
`Error suppression topic <https://qiskit.org/documentation/partners/qiskit_ibm_runtime/how_to/error-suppression.html#setting-the-optimization-level>`__.

The optimization level option is a "first level option", and can be set as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    from qiskit_ibm_runtime import Estimator, Options

    options = Options(optimization_level=2)

    # or..
    options = Options()
    options.optimization_level = 2

    estimator = Estimator(session=session, options=options)


You might want to configure your transpilation strategy further, and for this, there are advanced transpilation
options you can set up. These are "second level options", and can be set as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    from qiskit_ibm_runtime import Estimator, Options

    options = Options()
    options.transpilation.initial_layout = ...
    options.transpilation.routing_method = ...

    estimator = Estimator(session=session, options=options)

For more information, and a complete list of advanced transpilation options, see the Advanced transpilation options table in the 
`Error suppression topic <https://qiskit.org/documentation/partners/qiskit_ibm_runtime/how_to/error-suppression.html#advanced-transpilation-options>`__.

Finally, you might want to specify settings that are not available through the primitives interface,
or use custom transpiler passes. In these cases, you can set ``skip_transpilation=True`` to submit
user-transpiled circuits. To learn how this is done, refer to the 
`Submitting user-transpiled circuits using primitives tutorial <https://qiskit.org/documentation/partners/qiskit_ibm_runtime/tutorials/user-transpiled-circuits.html>`_.

The ``skip_transpilation`` option is an advanced transpilation option, set as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    from qiskit_ibm_runtime import Estimator, Options

    options = Options()
    options.transpilation.skip_transpilation = True

    estimator = Estimator(session=session, options=options)


3. Error mitigation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You might want to leverage different error mitigation methods and see how these affect the performance of your
algorithm. These can also be set through the ``resilience_level`` option. The method selected for each level is
different for ``Sampler`` and ``Estimator``. You can find more information in the 
`Configure error mitigation topic <https://qiskit.org/documentation/partners/qiskit_ibm_runtime/how_to/error-mitigation.html>`_.

The configuration is similar to the other options:

.. code-block:: python

    from qiskit_ibm_runtime import Estimator, Options

    options = Options(resilience_level = 2)

    # or...

    options = Options()
    options.resilience_level = 2

    estimator = Estimator(session=session, options=options)
