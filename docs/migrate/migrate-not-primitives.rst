Migration without primitives
=================================

.. 
    This page should be about migrating from qiskit-ibmq-provider to qiskit-ibm-runtime that is not related to primitives. This could include topics like import path, account management, channel selection, etc. This page does some of that but can use a lot more.

    I haven't added it to the TOC yet.
