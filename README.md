**Qiskit** is an open-source SDK for working with quantum computers at the level of circuits, algorithms, and application modules.

This project allows accessing the **[IBM Quantum]** systems and simulators.

## Installation

You can install this package using pip:

```bash
pip install qiskit-ibm-runtime
```

## Legacy Setup

1. Create an IBM Quantum account or log in to your existing account by visiting the [IBM Quantum login page].

1. Copy (and/or optionally regenerate) your API token from your
   [IBM Quantum account page].

1. Take your token from step 2, here called `MY_API_TOKEN`, and save it by calling `IBMRuntimeService.save_account()`:

   ```python
   from qiskit_ibm_runtime import IBMRuntimeService
   IBMRuntimeService.save_account(token='MY_API_TOKEN')
   ```

   The command above stores your credentials locally in a configuration file called `qiskitrc`. By default, this file is located in `$HOME/.qiskit`, where `$HOME` is your home directory.
   Once saved you can then instantiate the provider like below and access the backends:

   ```python
   from qiskit_ibm_runtime import IBMRuntimeService
   service = IBMRuntimeService()

   # display current supported backends
   print(service.backends())

   # get IBM's simulator backend
   simulator_backend = service.backend('ibmq_qasm_simulator')
   ```

### Load Account from Environment Variables
Alternatively, the service can discover credentials from environment variables:
```bash
export QISKIT_IBM_RUNTIME_API_TOKEN='MY_API_TOKEN'
```

Then instantiate the service without any arguments and access the backends:
```python
from qiskit_ibm_runtime import IBMRuntimeService
service = IBMRuntimeService()
```

### Enable Account for Current Session
As another alternative, you can also enable an account just for the current session by instantiating the service with the token.

```python
from qiskit_ibm_runtime import IBMRuntimeService
service = IBMRuntimeService(token='MY_API_TOKEN')
```
