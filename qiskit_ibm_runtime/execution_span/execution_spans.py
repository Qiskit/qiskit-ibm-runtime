    It is possible for distinct time windows to overlap. This is not because a QPU was performing
    multiple executions at once, but is instead an artifact of certain classical processing
    that may happen concurrently with quantum execution. The guarantee being made is that the
    referenced data definitely occurred in the reported execution span, but not necessarily that
    the limits of the time window are as tight as possible.
