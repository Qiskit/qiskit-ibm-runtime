    If ``True``, Post Selection is applied to all the learning circuits. In particular, the following steps
    are undertaken:

        * Using the passes in :mod:`qiskit_addon_utils.noise_management.post_selection.transpiler.passes`, the
          learning circuits are modified by adding measurements on the spectator qubits, as well as post
          selection measurements.
        * The results of each individual learning circuits are post selected by discarding the shots where one
          or more bits failed to flip, as explained in the docstring of
          :meth:`qiskit_addon_utils.noise_management.post_selection.PostSelector.compute_mask`.
