    Args:
        gates: Whether to apply 2-qubit gate twirling.
            By default, gate twirling is enabled for resilience level >0.

        measure: Whether to apply measurement twirling.
            By default, measurement twirling is enabled for resilience level >0.

        strategy: Specify the strategy of twirling qubits in identified layers of
            2-qubit twirled gates. Allowed values are

            - If ``"active"`` only the instruction qubits in each individual twirled
              layer will be twirled.
            - If ``"active-circuit"`` the union of all instruction qubits in the circuit
              will be twirled in each twirled layer.
            - If ``"active-accum"`` the union of instructions qubits in the circuit up to
              the current twirled layer will be twirled in each individual twirled layer.
            - If ``"all"`` all qubits in the input circuit will be twirled in each
              twirled layer.
            - If None twirling will be disabled.

            Default: ``"active-accum"`` for resilience levels 0, 1, 2. ``"active"`` for
                     resilience level 3.
