    """Mock for QiskitRuntimeService.

    Replace qiskit_ibm_runtime.QiskitRuntimeService with a mock that returns a single backend.
    Note this will set the value of qiskit_ibm_runtime.QiskitRuntimeService to a MagicMock object. It
    is intended to be run as part of docstrings with jupyter-example in a hidden
    cell so that later examples which rely on ibm quantum devices so that the docs can
    be built without requiring configured accounts. If used outside of this
    context be aware that you will have to manually restore qiskit_ibm_runtime.QiskitRuntimeService
    the value to qiskit_ibm_runtime.QiskitRuntimeService after you finish using your mock.

    Args:
        backend (str): The class name as a string for the fake device to
            return. For example, FakeVigo.

    Raises:
        NameError: If the specified value of backend
