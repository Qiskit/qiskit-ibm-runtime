0.14.0
======

New Features
------------

-  There is a new class, ``qiskit_ibm_runtime.Batch`` that currently
   works the same way as
   `qiskit_ibm_runtime.Session <https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/qiskit_ibm_runtime.Session>`__ but
   will later be updated to better support submitting multiple jobs at
   once.

-  Arbitrary keys and values are no longer allowed in ``Options``.

Deprecation Notes
-----------------

-  Custom programs are being deprecated as of qiskit-ibm-runtime 0.14.0
   and will be removed on November 27, 2023. Users can instead convert
   their custom programs to use Qiskit Runtime primitives with Qiskit
   Serverless. Refer to the migration guide for instructions:
   https://qiskit.github.io/qiskit-serverless/migration/migration_from_qiskit_runtime_programs.html
