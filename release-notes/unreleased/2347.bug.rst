Fixed the serialization of execution spans, to ensure that executions of old versions of qiskit-ibm-runtime will not crash when trying to decode newly encoded execution spans. However the deserialization with old versions will now return the execution spans in the format of a dictionary, and not in the form of an :class:`.ExecutionSpans` object. As part of this work, we also removed the `data_slice_version` field from :class:`.TwirledSliceSpan`; twirled slice spans that are aware of the pub shots are now managed by a new class :class:`.TwirledSliceSpanV2`.
