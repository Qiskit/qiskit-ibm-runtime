Added :class:`.TwirledSliceSpan`, an :class:`ExecutionSpan` to be used when 
twirling is enabled in the sampler. In particular, it keeps track of an extra shape
axis corresponding to twirling randomizations, and also whether this axis exists at
the front of the shape tuple, or right before the shots axis.
