Backend object cache in the :class:`.QiskitRuntimeService` was removed.
This indicates retrieving the backend from the same service instance incurs communication costs with the server each time.
You can always reuse the same backend instance to build primitives to run,
instead of retrieving the backend object from the service multiple times.
