The Sampler and Estimator V2 Primitives have been enhanced to incorporate custom validation procedures when
the channel_strategy property is set as "q-ctrl."
This customized validation logic effectively rectifies incorrect input options and safeguards users against
inadvertently disabling Q-CTRL's performance enhancements.
