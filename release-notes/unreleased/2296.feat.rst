With the migration to the new IBM Quantum Platform, there were a few inconsistencies with the old IBM Quantum 
Platform classic that needed to be addressed. 

    - :meth:`.QiskitRuntimeService.usage` now returns usage information for the current active IBM Cloud instance.
    - :meth:`.QiskitRuntimeService.delete_job` is not supported on the new platform so it has been deprecated.
    - :meth:`.RuntimeJobV2.instance` will now return the IBM Cloud instance crn. 
    - :meth:`.RuntimeJob.queue_usage` is also not supported on the new platform so it has been deprecated.
