When initializing an account with :class:`.QiskitRuntimeService`, if either ``token`` or ``url`` is passed in, 
the ``channel`` parameter is no longer required. Note that in this scenario where either of these parameters are passed in by themselves, 
they will be ignored and the saved default account will be used instead.
