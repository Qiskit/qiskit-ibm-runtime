The `requirements.txt` files and `setup.py` have been removed in favor of a new dependency management
approach using ``pyproject``. This transition simplifies the development workflow. Dependencies
are now managed directly through the `pyproject.toml` file.

    - Use ``pip install -e .`` to install qiskit-ibm-runtime dependencies.
    - Use ``pip install -e ".[dev]"`` to install the development dependencies.
    - Use ``pip install -e ".[visualization]"`` to install the visualization dependencies.
