`IBMInputValueError` inherits from `ValueError`, in addition to the existing parent class `IBMError`. Some validation functions, which previously raised `ValueError` exceptions, now raise `IBMInputValueError` exceptions. We added a validation that observables consist only of Pauli operations, residing in the alphabet {I, X, Y, Z}.
