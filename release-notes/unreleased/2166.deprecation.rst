The :class:`IBMBackend` attributes ``max_shots`` and ``max_experiments``, as well as the property 
``max_circuits`` have all been deprecated. These attribute values used to be the maximum number of
shots and circuits that could be submitted in one job but that is no longer the case. See 
our job limits `guide <https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/guides/job-limits#job-limits>`__ for more details.
