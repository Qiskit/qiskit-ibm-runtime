New parameters, ``tags``, and ``resource_group``, have been added to the 
:class:`.QiskitRuntimeService`   initializer and :meth:`.QiskitRuntimeService.save_account` method. 
These can be used to **prioritize** certain instances on the new platform 
(``ibm_quantum_platform``, and temporarily, ``ibm_cloud`` channels) 
without explicitly providing the CRN. In more detail:

    - ``tags``: Filter by a list of instance tags. 
    - ``resource_group``: Filter by instance resource group id.
