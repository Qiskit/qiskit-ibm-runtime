Add support for noise model and level 1 data to local sampler

The ``simulator.noise_model`` option of :class:`~.SamplerV2` is now passed
through to the :class:`~qiskit.primitives.BackendSamplerV2` as a `noise_model`
option under `run_options` if the primitive supports the `run_options` option
(support was added in Qiskit 1.3).

Similarly, the ``execution.meas_type`` option of :class:`~.SamplerV2` is now
translated into ``meas_level`` and ``meas_return`` options under
``run_options`` of the :class:`~qiskit.primitives.BackendSamplerV2` if it
supports ``run_options``. This change allows support for level 1 data in local
testing mode, where previously the only level 2 (classified) data was
supported.
