Since backends now support running jobs that contain both fractional gates and dynamic circuits, control flow 
instructions are no longer filtered out when using ``use_fractional_gates=True``. As a result, there is a new translation state plugin, 
:class:`~.IBMDynamicFractionalTranslationPlugin`, for targeting circuits with both 
dynamic circuits and fractional gates.

:class:`~.IBMFractionalTranslationPlugin` and :class:`~.IBMDynamicTranslationPlugin` are deprecated 
since they are no longer necessary.
