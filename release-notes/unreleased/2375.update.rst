When :class:`.QiskitRuntimeService` is initialized without an instance 
and there is no saved account instance, there will now be a warning detailing 
the current filters (``tags``, ``region``, ``plans_preference``) and available instances. Additionally, 
by default, only free and trial pricing plan accounts will be available. 
Paid or subscription instances **will not** be available unless ``instance`` or
``plans_preference`` are explicitly specified. There will also be warning messages to tell users whether or not they're using
a saved account.

When retrieving a backend and an instance is automatically selected, there will be a warning with
the instance name and plan type. 

It is now also possible to initialize :class:`.QiskitRuntimeService` with just a token. Since the ``ibm_quantum``
channel name has been removed and both the ``ibm_cloud`` and ``ibm_quantum_platform`` channels point to the same
API, the ``channel`` parameter is no longer required. ``ibm_quantum_platform`` is the default channel.
