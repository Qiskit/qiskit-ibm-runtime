When :class:`.QiskitRuntimeService` is initialized without an instance 
and there is no saved account instance, there will now be a warning detailing 
the current filters (``tags``, ``region``, ``plans_preference``) and available instances. If ``plans_preference``
is not set, free and trial plan instances will be prioritized over paid instances. 

Additional warnings have also been added to make the current active insance more clear:

    - Warning messages to tell users whether they're using a saved account or a new account.
    - When retrieving a backend and an instance is automatically selected, there will be a warning with
      the instance name and plan type. 

It is now also possible to initialize :class:`.QiskitRuntimeService` with just a token. Since the ``ibm_quantum``
channel name has been removed and both the ``ibm_cloud`` and ``ibm_quantum_platform`` channels point to the same
API, the ``channel`` parameter is no longer required. ``ibm_quantum_platform`` is the default channel.
