The ``channel_strategy`` parameter has been deprecated.
The Q-CTRL Performance Management strategy will be removed on October 18th, 2024. 
To continue using Q-CTRL in your workflow, please explore the following options:

- If your organization has an existing IBM Quantum Premium Plan instance: migrate to 
the Q-CTRL Performance Management Function, found in the 
`Qiskit Functions Catalog <https://quantum.ibm.com/functions>`__.

- To continue using Qiskit Runtime with IBM Cloud: migrate to Q-CTRL Fire Opal, 
the same performance management product accessible directly through Q-CTRL. 
You can `connect your IBM Cloud API key and Qiskit Runtime CRN <https://docs.q-ctrl.com/fire-opal/discover/hardware-providers/how-to-authenticate-with-ibm-credentials>`__
to Fire Opal.
