The deprecations from the ``0.26.0`` release have been removed.

    - Passing a backend as a string into ``Session``, ``Batch``, 
    ``Sampler``, and ``Estimator`` is no longer valid. Use the actual backend
    object instead.
    - Passing a backend as the mode into ``SamplerV2`` or ``EstimatorV2`` used
    to run jobs in job mode, even if a session context manager was open. These jobs will now
    run inside of the open session. Additionally, if a backend that is different
    from the session backend is passed in as the mode, an error will be raised. 
    - ``Service`` is no longer a valid parameter in ``Session`` and ``Batch``.
