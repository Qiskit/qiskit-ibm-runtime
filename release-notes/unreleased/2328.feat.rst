Added a new function :meth:`.visualization.draw_circuit_schedule_timing` to plot circuit schedule 
timing data returned in job result metadata. This is currently a beta feature and requires the 
``"scheduler_timing"`` experimental option to be set to ``True``, as shown below. This is 
currently only available to ``Sampler`` jobs.

.. code python

    sampler = SamplerV2(backend)
    sampler.options.experimental = { 
        "execution": {
            "scheduler_timing": True,
        },
    }

The circuit schedule data can then be accessed from the job's result metadata as follows,

.. code python

    job_result: SamplerPubResult = job.result()
    circuit_schedule = job_result[0].metadata["compilation"]["scheduler_timing"]
    circuit_schedule_timing = circuit_schedule["timing"]

This function uses the new :class:`CircuitSchedule` class to load, parse, preprocess, 
and trace the data for plotting using a Plotly supported interface.
