Fixed an issue where if there was no instance saved nor passed in at initialization, the service could not make
any api calls until :meth:`.QiskitRuntimeService.backend` or :meth:`.QiskitRuntimeService.backends` is called first.

Fixed a bug where if ``use_fractional_gates`` is set but the backend configuration was already cached, 
the incorrect configuration could be returned.
