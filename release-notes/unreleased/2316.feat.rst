The `qiskit-ibm-runtime` package has been extended with two new modules: :mod:`.circuit` and 
:mod:`.circuit.library`. These modules are designed to mirror the structure of the 
corresponding `qiskit` SDK modules, while providing vendor-specific implementations of 
circuit objects and instructions.

The first addition to this new circuit library is the :class:`.MidCircuitMeasure` class. 
This class enables the creation of instructions that follow the naming convention 
`measure_<identifier>`, which are mapped to specific mid-circuit measurement
 hardware instructions matching that pattern.
