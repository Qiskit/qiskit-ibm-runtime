Fixed a bug in :class:`.BasePrimitive` where primitives instantiated inside a :class:`~.Session` or :class:`~.Batch` context manager would fetch the backend
from the service (by name) instead of using the backend passed to the :class:`~.Session` or :class:`~.Batch`. This could cause issues when the :class:`~.Session`/:class:`~.Batch`
backend was modified by users (for example, by removing a gate), because the primitives 
would instead fetch the unmodified backend object from the service. After the fix, the
:class:`~.Session`/:class:`~.Batch` backend object is used directly.
