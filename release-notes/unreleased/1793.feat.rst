The :class:`QiskitRuntimeLocalService` was created to support a local
testing mode. To avoid having to initialize a separate class, "local"
has been added to the valid :class:`QiskitRuntimeService` channel.

.. code:: python
    service=QiskitRuntimeService(channel="local")

a :class:`QiskitRuntimeLocalService` instance will be returned.
