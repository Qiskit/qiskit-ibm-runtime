While creating backend objects from cache when ``use_fractional_gates`` flag is used, 
`.QiskitRuntimeService` used to check for only ``rzz`` gates in the backend's basis. 
Now `.QiskitRuntimeService` will now check for both ``rzz`` and ``rx`` gates in the 
backend's basis gates to decide whether to refresh the configuration or fetch 
from cache.
