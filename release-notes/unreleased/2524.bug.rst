While creating backend objects, `.QiskitRuntimeService` previously checked for only ``rzz``
gates in the backend's basis gates to decide whether to use cache or create a new backend 
object. Now `.QiskitRuntimeService` will check for both ``rzz`` and ``rx`` gates in the 
backend's basis gates to decide whether to refresh the configuration or fetch 
from cache.
