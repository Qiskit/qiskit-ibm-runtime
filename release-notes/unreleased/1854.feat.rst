The methods ``job()``, ``jobs()``, and ``delete_jobs()`` have been added to 
:class:`QiskitRuntimeLocalService`. Jobs run in local mode will now be 
automatically saved into a local directory. This directory defaults to 
``qiskit_ibm_runtime/fake_provider/local_jobs`` but can be customized with the 
``QISKIT_LOCAL_JOBS_DIRECTORY`` environment variable.
