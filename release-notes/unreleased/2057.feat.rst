Jobs run in the local testing mode will now return an instance of a new class, 
:class:`.LocalRuntimeJob`. This new class inherits from Qiskit's ``PrimitiveJob`` class 
while adding the methods and properties found in :class:`.BaseRuntimeJob`. This way, running jobs 
in the local testing mode will be more similar to running jobs on a real backend.
