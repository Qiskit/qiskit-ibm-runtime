A new function ``validate_rzz_pubs`` was added. The function verifies that ``rzz`` parameters are in the range between ``0`` and ``pi/2``, for numeric parameters (e.g. ``rzz(np.pi/4, 0)``), and for unbounded parameters (``rzz(theta, 0)``) with values to substitute provided in the pub. Parameter expressions (e.g. ``rzz(theta + phi, 0)``) are still not validated.
