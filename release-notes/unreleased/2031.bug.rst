The behavior of the ``use_fractional_gates`` argument of
:meth:`.QiskitRuntimeService.backend` has been changed. When the option is set
to ``False``, it now filters all references to fractional gates out of the
configuration and properties data from the API. Likewise, when the option is
set to ``True``, all dynamic circuit instructions are filtered from the
configuration and properties data. Previously, this option only impacted the
creation of the backend's target, which meant that the instructions in the
target were not consistent with those in the configuration and properties data.
For the most part, this change should be transparent to users, but if there is
code relying on the configuration and properties data containing all
instructions it will need to be updated (note that setting
``use_fractional_gates`` to ``None`` will load all instructions without
filtering).
