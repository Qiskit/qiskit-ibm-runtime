The :meth:`.QiskitRuntimeService.least_busy` method was returning no backends or the incorrect backend because the 
API response we were depending on was returning strings with an uppercase first letter while we were expecting 
a fully lowercase string. This has been fixed, we no longer depend on this field. This field is labled as an optional
string in the backend schema so we never should have depended on it in the first place.
