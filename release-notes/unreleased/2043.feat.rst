Added a new transpiler translation plugin :class:`~.IBMFractionalTranslationPlugin` 
and a pass :class:`~.FoldRzzAngle`.
This plugin is automatically applied for backends
retrieved with the ``use_fractional_gates`` opt-in,
and the folding pass is added when the backend target includes the ``RZZ`` gate.

The new pass modifies the input quantum circuit, so that all ``RZZ`` gates in the
circuit have an angle parameter within [0, pi/2] which is supported 
by IBM Quantum processors.
