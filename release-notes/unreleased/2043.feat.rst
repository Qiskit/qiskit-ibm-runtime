Add new transpiler translation plugin :class:`IBMFractionalTranslationPlugin` 
and a pass :class:`FoldRzzAngle`.
This plugin is automatically appled for backends
retrieved with the `use_fractional_gates` optin,
and the folding pass is added when the backend target includes the `RZZ` gate.

New pass modifies the input quantum circuit so that all `RZZ` gates in the
circuit has an angle parameter within [0, pi/2] which is supported 
by IBM Quantum processors.
