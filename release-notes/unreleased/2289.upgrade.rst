Since IBM Quantum Platform Classic was sunset on 1 July, 2025, the ``ibm_quantum`` channel is no
longer supported from ``qiskit-ibm-runtime``. Saved ``ibm_quantum`` channel accounts and data will not be accessible. 
Use the ``ibm_quantum_platform`` channel instead. See our 
[migration guide](https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/migration-guides/classic-iqp-to-cloud-iqp) 
for more details.
