0.33.0 (2024-11-07)
===================

New Features
------------

- Added :func:`~.draw_layer_errors_swarm` which draws a swarm plot of one or more
  :class:`~.LayerError` objects. Also added the convenience method
  :meth:`~.LayerError.draw_swarm` to invoke the drawing function on a particular instance. (`1988 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-ibm-runtime/pull/1988>`__)
- Added :class:`.TwirledSliceSpan`, an :class:`ExecutionSpan` to be used when 
  twirling is enabled in the Sampler. In particular, it keeps track of an extra shape
  axis corresponding to twirling randomizations, and also whether this axis exists at
  the front of the shape tuple, or right before the shots axis. (`2011 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-ibm-runtime/pull/2011>`__)


Bug Fixes
---------

- Fixed the location of hover text on the ``draw_execution_spans()`` function. Previous to this fix,
  they were drawn on the wrong markers. (`2014 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-ibm-runtime/pull/2014>`__)


Other Notes
-----------

- The remaining fake V1 backends - ``FakeMelbourne``, ``FakePoughkeepsie``,
  ``FakeTenerife``, ``FakeTokyo``, and ``FakeRueschlikon`` have been removed. (`2012 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-ibm-runtime/pull/2012>`__)
