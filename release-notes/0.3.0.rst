0.3.0
=====

Upgrade Notes
-------------

-  A new parameter ``channel`` has now been added to
   ``qiskit_ibm_runtime.IBMRuntimeService`` class and also to methods
   like ``save_account()``, ``saved_accounts()`` and
   ``delete_account()``. It can be set to ``ibm_quantum`` or
   ``ibm_cloud`` to authenticate to either of the two different channels
   through which Qiskit Runtime service is currently offered.
   ``channel`` replaces the ``auth`` parameter which has now been
   deprecated.

Deprecation Notes
-----------------

-  The ``auth`` parameter to ``qiskit_ibm_runtime.IBMRuntimeService``
   class and also to methods like ``save_account()``,
   ``saved_accounts()`` and ``delete_account()`` has now been deprecated
   and will be removed in a future release. Please use the new
   ``channel`` parameter instead.

Bug Fixes
---------

-  Fixed
   `#291 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-ibm-runtime/issues/219>`__
   where passing a single ``QuantumCircuit`` to sampler or estimator
   primitives was throwing an error.
