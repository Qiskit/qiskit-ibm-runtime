0.42.0 (2025-09-15)
===================

Upgrade Notes
-------------

- When :class:`.QiskitRuntimeService` is initialized without an instance 
  and there is no saved account instance, there will now be a warning detailing 
  the current filters (``tags``, ``region``, ``plans_preference``) and available instances. If ``plans_preference``
  is not set, free and trial plan instances will be prioritized over paid instances. 

  Additional warnings have also been added to make the current active instance more clear:

      - Warning messages to tell users whether they're using a saved account or a new account.
      - When retrieving a backend and an instance is automatically selected, there will be a warning with
        the instance name and plan type. 

  It is now also possible to initialize :class:`.QiskitRuntimeService` with just a token. Since the ``ibm_quantum``
  channel name has been removed and both the ``ibm_cloud`` and ``ibm_quantum_platform`` channels point to the same
  API, the ``channel`` parameter is no longer required. ``ibm_quantum_platform`` is the default channel. (`2375 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-ibm-runtime/pull/2375>`__)

- Since support for streaming results was removed in ``0.32.0``, the deprecated (``0.38.0``) environment option
  ``callback`` as well as the ``BaseRuntimeJob`` parameters ``client_params`` and ``user_callback`` have been removed.

  The ``RuntimeJob`` class has also been removed. All primitives return jobs as ``RuntimeJobV2``. Typehints across the 
  codebase have also been updated to reflect this change. (`2298 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-ibm-runtime/pull/2298>`__)
- :meth:`.RuntimeJobV2.properties` will now fetch the backend properties from when the job was running 
  instead of when the job was created. (`2369 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-ibm-runtime/pull/2369>`__)
