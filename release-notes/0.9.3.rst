0.9.3
=====

Upgrade Notes
-------------

-  Added error messages in case the user defines unsupported values for
   ‘optimization_level’ or for ‘resilience_level’. Added validation
   checking for options given as input to ``resilience``. Previously,
   this validation was done on the server side. By adding them on the
   client side, response will be much faster upon failure. The
   environment variable ``QISKIT_RUNTIME_SKIP_OPTIONS_VALIDATION`` is
   used to control validation. If set, validation will be skipped.

-  Backend configurations are no longer loaded when
   `QiskitRuntimeService <https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/qiskit_ibm_runtime.QiskitRuntimeService>`__
   is initialized. Instead, the configuration is only loaded and cached
   during
   `get_backend() <https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/0.29/qiskit_ibm_runtime.QiskitRuntimeService#get_backend>`__
   and
   `backends() <https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/qiskit_ibm_runtime.QiskitRuntimeService#backends>`__.

Bug Fixes
---------

-  When creating an Option object and passing an input option to
   ``resilience_options``, this option was included in
   ``resilience_options``, but the other, default options were removed.
   This was fixed, so now inputs are handled correctly, like other
   option types.
