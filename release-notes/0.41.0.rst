0.41.0 (2025-07-24)
===================

Prelude
-------

The qiskit-ibm-runtime ``v0.41.0`` release focuses on the removal of IBM Quantum Platform Classic and improving 
the user experience for the new IBM Quantum Platform. Among new features, improvements, and minor bug fixes, 
the release highlights are:

  - The ``ibm_quantum`` channel and IQP Classic are no longer supported. 
  - :meth:`.QiskitRuntimeService.least_busy` is significantly faster. 
  - :meth:`.QiskitRuntimeService.usage` has been updated to return information regarding the current 
    instance usage limit, consumption, and time remaining. 


Upgrade Notes
-------------

- Because of the sunset of IBM Quantum Platform Classic, the ``ibm_quantum`` channel is no
  longer supported from ``qiskit-ibm-runtime``. Saved ``ibm_quantum`` channel accounts and 
  data will not be accessible. Use the ``ibm_quantum_platform`` channel instead. See our 
  `migration guide <https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/migration-guides/classic-iqp-to-cloud-iqp>`__
  for more details. (`2289 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-ibm-runtime/pull/2289>`__)


New Features
------------

- A new parameter, ``tags``, has been added to the 
  :class:`.QiskitRuntimeService` initializer and :meth:`.QiskitRuntimeService.save_account` method. 
  ``tags`` can be used to **filter** instances so only instances with the given tags are 
  returned.

  Additionally, if no valid instances are returned when using the ``tags``, ``region``, or ``plans_preference`` filters,  
  an error will now be raised at initialization. Make sure the names of the ``tags`` and ``region`` passed in  
  match the instance ``tags`` or ``region`` exactly (case-insensitive). For ``plans_preference``, as long as a matching
  plan name is passed in, instances with the matching plan name will be prioritized. (`2277 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-ibm-runtime/pull/2277>`__)
- With the migration to the new IBM Quantum Platform, there were a few inconsistencies with IBM Quantum 
  Platform Classic that needed to be addressed:

      - :meth:`.QiskitRuntimeService.usage` now returns usage information for the current active IBM Cloud instance.
      - :meth:`.QiskitRuntimeService.delete_job` is not supported on the new platform, so it has been deprecated.
      - :meth:`.RuntimeJobV2.instance` will now return the IBM Cloud instance CRN. 
      - :meth:`.RuntimeJob.queue_usage` is not supported on the new platform, so it has been deprecated. (`2296 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-ibm-runtime/pull/2296>`__)
- Support for running ``qiskit-ibm-runtime`` with Python 3.9 has been deprecated and will
  be removed in a future release. 

  Additionally, ``qiskit-ibm-runtime`` now officialy supports Python 3.13. (`2314 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-ibm-runtime/pull/2314>`__)
- When saving an account, there is now a validation check to make sure the ``region``, 
  ``plans_preference``, and ``tags`` parameters are valid. (`2319 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-ibm-runtime/pull/2319>`__)
- There is a new method, :meth:`.QiskitRuntimeService.active_instance` which returns the IBM Cloud CRN 
  of the current active instance. 

  The :meth:`.QiskitRuntimeService.jobs` method has been updated to properly accept the ``instance`` 
  parameter, which can be used to filter jobs. (`2325 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-ibm-runtime/pull/2325>`__)
- :meth:`.QiskitRuntimeService.usage` has been updated to include a ``usage_remaining_seconds`` field. 
  This field includes the difference between the reported ``usage_limit_seconds`` or ``usage_allocation_seconds`` 
  (depending on how the instance is configured) and ``usage_consumed_seconds``. 
  Learn more about instance allocation limits `here <https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/docs/guides/allocation-limits>`__. (`2329 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-ibm-runtime/pull/2329>`__)

- :meth:`~.FakeBackendV2.refresh` has a new parameter, ``use_fractional_gates``, that can be set to ``True``
  to allow the fake backend to include fractional gates. Note that this method only works if you have access
  to the real backend. (`2342 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-ibm-runtime/pull/2342>`__)

- The :class:`.QiskitRuntimeService` has been updated to use a new API version. With the new version, 
  the :meth:`.QiskitRuntimeService.least_busy` method has been updated to take advantage of the updated ``BackendsResponseV2`` 
  which makes it significantly faster. (`2323 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-ibm-runtime/pull/2323>`__)

- Class :class:`.TwirledSliceSpan` has a new data member ``data_slice_version`` of type integer, with default value 1. 
  When set to 2, the data slice tuples contain information about the PUB shots, used in :meth:`.TwirledSliceSpan.mask` 
  to shape the returned array. The last axis will be truncated, such that its length will be shortened to ``pub_shots``. (`2312 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-ibm-runtime/pull/2312>`__)

- Added serialization for :class:`qiskit.quantum_info.PauliLindbladMap`. (`2297 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-ibm-runtime/pull/2297>`__)

- There is a new method :meth:`.convert_to_rzz_valid_pub`, which can be used to transform a PUB into an equivalent PUB that is compatible with Rzz constraints. 
  The method currently does not support dynamic circuits and does not preserve global phase. (`2126 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-ibm-runtime/pull/2126>`__)

Bug Fixes
---------

- Fixed a bug in :class:`.BasePrimitive` where primitives instantiated inside a :class:`~.Session` or :class:`~.Batch` context manager without the ``mode`` 
  parameter would fetch the backend from the service (by name) instead of using the backend passed to the :class:`~.Session` or :class:`~.Batch`. 
  This could cause issues when the :class:`~.Session` or :class:`~.Batch`
  backend was modified by users (for example, by removing a gate), because the primitives 
  would instead fetch the unmodified backend object from the service. After the fix, the
  :class:`~.Session` or :class:`~.Batch` backend object is used directly. (`2282 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-ibm-runtime/pull/2282>`__)
- Fixed an issue in :class:`.IBMBackend` where property changes, such as modifications to ``basis_gates``, persisted even after the backend object was renewed. (`2283 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-ibm-runtime/pull/2283>`__)


Other Notes
-----------

- The deprecated :class:`.IBMBackend` attributes, ``max_shots`` and 
  ``max_experiments``, have been removed and the :meth:`.IBMBackend.max_circuits` method now
  returns ``None``. See the `job limits guide <https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/docs/guides/job-limits#job-limits>`__ for details. (`2235 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-ibm-runtime/pull/2235>`__)
- The deprecated :class:`~.IBMBackend` and :class:`~.FakeBackendV2` ``defaults()`` methods 
  have been removed. They were deprecated in the v0.38.0 release. 
  Pulse defaults have also been removed from all fake backends. (`2238 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-ibm-runtime/pull/2238>`__)
- Improved the error message returned when :meth:`.ExecutionSpan.mask` is called for a PUB that's not contained in the span. (`2311 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-ibm-runtime/pull/2311>`__)
