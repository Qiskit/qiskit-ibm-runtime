0.9.0
=====

Upgrade Notes
-------------

-  Changed the default values for ``optimization_level`` and for
   ``resilience_level`` in ``qiskit_ibm_runtime.Options``. If their
   values are defined by the user, they are not modified. If not set, if
   the backend is a noiseless simulator then ``optimization_level`` is
   set to 1 and ``resilience_level`` is set to 0; Otherwise, they are be
   set to 3 and 1 respectively.

-  `session_id() <https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/docs/api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/0.41/runtime-job#session_id>`__ and
   `tags() <https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/docs/api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/0.41/runtime-job#tags>`__ were added for an
   easy way to return the session_id and job_tags of a job.

Bug Fixes
---------

-  Fixed a bug where jobs that did not run before a session closes are
   not actually run as a part of that session. Jobs should run as a part
   of a session even if that session is closed by the exit of the
   context manager.

-  Fixes the issue wherein submitting a large job fails due to write
   operation timeout.
