===================

Deprecation Notes
-----------------

- ``name`` will now be a required parameter in 
  `backend() <https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/qiskit_ibm_runtime.QiskitRuntimeService#backend>`__.
  ``backend()`` will no longer return the first backend out of all backends if ``name`` is not provided. (`1147 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-ibm-runtime/pull/1147>`__)
- After the removal of custom programs, the following methods are being deprecated and renamed.
  :meth:`qiskit_ibm_runtime.QiskitRuntimeService.run` is deprecated and will be replaced by a private method
  :meth:`qiskit_ibm_runtime.QiskitRuntimeService._run`.

  :meth:`qiskit_ibm_runtime.Session.run` is deprecated and will be replaced by a private method
  :meth:`qiskit_ibm_runtime.Session._run`.

  :meth:`qiskit_ibm_runtime.RuntimeJob.program_id` is deprecated and will be replaced by
  :meth:`qiskit_ibm_runtime.RuntimeJob.primitive_id`. (`1238 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-ibm-runtime/pull/1238>`__)
- The ``backend`` parameter in `Sampler <https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/run/primitives-get-started#3-initialize-the-qiskit-runtime-sampler>`__ 
  and `Estimator <https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/run/primitives-get-started#3-initialize-qiskit-runtime-estimator>`__ has been deprecated. 
  Please use ``mode`` instead.
  The ``session`` argument in `Sampler <https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/run/primitives-get-started#3-initialize-the-qiskit-runtime-sampler>`__ and 
  `Estimator <https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/run/primitives-get-started#3-initialize-qiskit-runtime-estimator>`__ has also been deprecated. 
  Please use ``mode`` instead. (`1556 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-ibm-runtime/pull/1556>`__)
- :meth:`qiskit_ibm_runtime.QiskitRuntimeService.get_backend` is deprecated. Please
  :meth:`qiskit_ibm_runtime.QiskitRuntimeService.backend` use instead.
  The V1 fake backends, :class:`.FakeBackend`, along with :class:`.FakeProvider` are also
  being deprecated in favor of the V2 fake backends and :class:`.FakeProviderForBackendV2`. (`1689 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-ibm-runtime/pull/1689>`__)
  


New Features
------------

- Related to the execution modes, Sampler and Estimator now include a ``mode`` argument. The ``mode`` parameter
  can be a Backend, Session, Batch, or None. As a result, the backend name has been deprecated, and will
  no longer be supported as a valid execution mode. (`1556 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-ibm-runtime/pull/1556>`__)
- The ``ZneOptions.amplifier`` option was added, which can be one of these strings:

  * ``"gate_folding"`` (default) uses 2-qubit gate folding to amplify noise. If the noise
    factor requires amplifying only a subset of the gates, then these gates are chosen
    randomly.
  * ``"gate_folding_front"`` uses 2-qubit gate folding to amplify noise. If the noise
    factor requires amplifying only a subset of the gates, then these gates are selected
    from the front of the topologically ordered DAG circuit.
  * ``"gate_folding_back"`` uses 2-qubit gate folding to amplify noise. If the noise
    factor requires amplifying only a subset of the gates, then these gates are selected
    from the back of the topologically ordered DAG circuit. (`1679 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-ibm-runtime/pull/1679>`__)
- When saving an account, there is a new parameter, ``private_endpoint`` that if set to ``True``, allows
  users to connect to a private IBM Cloud API. 
  This parameter can also be used when the service is initialized ``QiskitRuntimeService(private_endpoint = True)``. (`1699 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-ibm-runtime/pull/1699>`__)
- Qiskit version ``1.1`` is now supported and required. (`1700 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-ibm-runtime/pull/1700>`__)

Bug Fixes
---------

- Fixed an issue where retrieving jobs with 
  `job() <https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/qiskit_ibm_runtime.QiskitRuntimeService#job>`__
  and `jobs() <https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/qiskit_ibm_runtime.QiskitRuntimeService#jobs>`__
  would only return ``RuntimeJob`` instances, even if the job was run with a V2 primitive. Now, 
  V2 primitive jobs will be returned correctly as ``RuntimeJobV2`` instances. (`1471 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-ibm-runtime/pull/1471>`__)
- To avoid network disruptions during long job processes, websocket errors will no longer be raised. (`1518 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-ibm-runtime/pull/1518>`__)
- Fixed the combination of ``insert_multiple_cycles`` and ``coupling_map`` options in
  :class:`.PadDynamicalDecoupling`. This combination allows to select staggered 
  dynamical decoupling with multiple sequence cycles in each delay that crosses 
  the threshold set by ``sequence_min_length_ratios``. (`1630 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-ibm-runtime/pull/1630>`__)
- Fixed a serialization issue where decoding job metadata resulted in an error. (`1682 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-ibm-runtime/pull/1682>`__)
- The backend utils method ``convert_to_target`` has been replaced with the 
  `convert_to_target <https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/api/qiskit/qiskit.providers.convert_to_target>`__ method from Qiskit.
  This fixes some issues related to target generation and calibration data. (`1600 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-ibm-runtime/pull/1600>`__)
