===================

Bug Fixes
---------

- While creating backend objects, `.QiskitRuntimeService` used to check for only ``rzz`` 
  gates in the backend's basis gates to decide whether to use cache or create a new backend 
  object. Now `.QiskitRuntimeService` will check for both ``rzz`` and ``rx`` gates in the 
  backend's basis gates to decide whether to refresh the configuration or fetch 
  from cache. (`2524 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-ibm-runtime/pull/2524>`__)
- The initilization of ``QiskitRuntimeService`` does no longer fail if retrieving
  the catalog information of an instance is not possible (for example, due to the
  instance being archived). (`2603 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-ibm-runtime/pull/2603>`__)
