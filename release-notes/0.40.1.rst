0.40.1 (2025-06-04)
===================

Bug Fixes
---------

- Fixed an issue where if there was no instance saved nor passed in at initialization, the service could not make
  any API calls until :meth:`.QiskitRuntimeService.backend` or :meth:`.QiskitRuntimeService.backends` is called first.

- Fixed a bug where if ``use_fractional_gates`` is set but the backend configuration was already cached, 
  the incorrect configuration could be returned. (`2269 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-ibm-runtime/pull/2269>`__)


Other Notes
-----------

- Error messages related to ``rzz`` gate angles being outside of the allowed
  range of 0 to :math:`\pi/2` during circuit validation have been updated to
  clarify that the angle value requested in the circuit was the problem and not
  an angle value provided by the backend. (`2276 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-ibm-runtime/pull/2276>`__)
