0.11.3
======

New Features
------------

-  Added reason for failure when invoking the method
   `error_message() <https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/qiskit_ibm_runtime.RuntimeJob#error_message>`__.

-  Added a new property,
   `usage_estimation() <https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/qiskit_ibm_runtime.RuntimeJob#usage_estimation>`__
   that returns the estimated system execution time,
   ``quantum_seconds``. System execution time represents the amount of
   time that the system is dedicated to processing your job.

-  Raise an exception if the number of circuits passed to
   ``_run_primitive()`` exceeds the number of circuits supported on the
   backend.

-  There is a new method
   `update_tags() <https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/qiskit_ibm_runtime.RuntimeJob#update_tags>`__
   that can be used to update the ``job_tags`` of a job.

-  If ``instance`` is provided as parameter to
   `qiskit_ibm_runtime.QiskitRuntimeService <https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/qiskit_ibm_runtime.QiskitRuntimeService>`__,
   then this is used as a filter in ``QiskitRuntimeService.backends()``.
   If ``instance`` is not recognized as one of the provider instances,
   an exception will be raised. Previously, we only issued a warning.
