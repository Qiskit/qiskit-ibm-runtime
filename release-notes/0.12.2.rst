0.12.2
======

New Features
------------

-  If using a ``channel_strategy``, only backends that support that
   ``channel_strategy`` will be accessible to the user.

-  Added the option to define a default account in the account json
   file. To select an account as default, define ``set_as_default=True``
   in ``QiskitRuntimeService.save_account()``.

-  Added new method ``Session.from_id`` which creates a new session with
   a given id.

-  There will now be a warning if a user submits a job that is predicted
   to exceed their system execution time monthly quota of 10 minutes.
   This only applies to jobs run on real hardware in the instance
   ``ibm-q/open/main``. If the job does end up exceeding the quota, it
   will be canceled.

Upgrade Notes
-------------

-  Job error messages now include the error code. Error codes can be
   found in `errors <https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/errors>`__.
