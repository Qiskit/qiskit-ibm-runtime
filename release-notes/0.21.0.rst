0.21.0
======

Upgrade Notes
-------------

-  Circuits that do not match the target hardware definition are no
   longer supported by Qiskit Runtime primitives, unless
   ``channel_strategy="q-ctrl"`` is used. See the transpilation
   documentation (`transpile <https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/guides/transpile>`__) for instructions to
   transform circuits and the primitive examples
   (`run/primitives-examples <https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/guides/primitives-examples>`__) to see this
   coupled with operator transformations.

Deprecation Notes
-----------------

-  In a future release, ``backend`` will be a required parameter for
   ``qiskit_ibm_runtime.Sampler``, and ``qiskit_ibm_runtime.Estimator``
   if ``session`` is not specified, even when using the ``ibm_cloud``
   channel.

   It will also be a required parameter for
   ``qiskit_ibm_runtime.Session`` and ``qiskit_ibm_runtime.Batch``.

Bug Fixes
---------

-  Fixed an issue with the ``IBMBackend.target`` where it would
   incorrectly exclude supported control flow operations (``IfElseOp``,
   ``WhileLoop``, etc.) if a given backend supported them.

-  Fixed a bug where retrieving a fake backend through
   ``FakeProviderForBackendV2.backend()`` would result in a type error.

-  Fixes the check for ISA circuits to allow pulse gates and circuits
   that donâ€™t have layout.
