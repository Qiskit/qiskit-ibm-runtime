=====

New Features
------------

-  ``qiskit_ibm_runtime.IBMEstimator`` and
   ``qiskit_ibm_runtime.IBMSampler`` classes now allow you to easily
   interact with the ``estimator`` and ``sampler`` primitive programs.
   Refer to the examples in the respective class doc strings to learn
   more about how to use them.

Bug Fixes
---------

-  Fixed a bug where
   `qiskit_ibm_runtime.RuntimeJob.wait_for_final_state() <https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/docs/api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/0.41/runtime-job#wait_for_final_state>`__
   would result in a NoneType error if the job already completed and
   `qiskit_ibm_runtime.RuntimeJob.status() <https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/docs/api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/0.41/runtime-job#status>`__
   was called beforehand.
