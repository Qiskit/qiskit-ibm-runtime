0.44.0 (2025-12-16)
===================

New Features
------------

- When a job is submitted, there will now be warnings if the instance being used
  has reached its limit. (`2458 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-ibm-runtime/pull/2458>`__)
- Added a "Fake Nighthawk" (:class:`.FakeNighthawk`) backend to the :mod:`.fake_provider` module.

  Its coupling map and basis gates match those of a real Nighthawk backend, but 
  the properties are not  intended to represent typical Nighthawk error values. 
  You can use this fake backend to, for example, transpile and optimize your 
  circuits in preparation for the forthcoming Nighthawk backends. For a 100-qubit 
  square lattice Ising circuit with 10 Trotter steps, ``FakeNighthawk`` showed a 
  600% improvement in circuit depth compared to a Heron backend. (`2476 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-ibm-runtime/pull/2476>`__)


Bug Fixes
---------

- IAM authentification bug fix when using a proxy configuration specified in ``QiskitRuntimeService``. 
  The patch injects the ``proxies`` and ``verify`` attributes from ``QiskitRuntimeService`` into ``IAMTokenManager`` when using cloud authentification (``CloudAuth``). (`2344 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-ibm-runtime/pull/2344>`__)


Other Notes
-----------

- The deprecated methods ``check_pending_jobs()`` and ``delete_job()`` methods, along with 
  support for Python 3.9, have been removed. (`2439 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-ibm-runtime/pull/2439>`__)
- Added :class:`CircuitSchedule` as an optional input to :meth:`draw_circuit_schedule_timing`.
  This allows for manual preprocessing of the circuit schedule timing data outside of its draw function. (`2457 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-ibm-runtime/pull/2457>`__)
