0.44.0 (2025-12-16)
===================

New Features
------------

- When a job is submitted, there will now be warnings if the instance being used
  has reached its limit. (`2458 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-ibm-runtime/pull/2458>`__)
- Added a "Fake Nighthawk" (:class:`.FakeNighthawk`) backend to the :mod:`.fake_provider` module.

  Its coupling map and basis gates match those of a real Nighthawk backend, but 
  the properties are not  intended to represent typical Nighthawk error values. 
  You can use this fake backend to, for example, transpile and optimize your 
  circuits in preparation of the forthcoming Nighthawk backends. For a 100-qubit 
  square lattice Ising circuit with 10 Trotter steps, ``FakeNighthawk`` showed a 
  600% improvement in circuit depth compared to a Heron backend.

  Example:

  .. code:: python

      from qiskit import QuantumCircuit
      from qiskit.transpiler import generate_preset_pass_manager
      from qiskit_ibm_runtime.fake_provider import FakeNighthawk
      from qiskit_ibm_runtime import SamplerV2 as Sampler

      # Initialize fake_nighthawk
      backend = FakeNighthawk()

      # Initialize quantum circuit
      qc = QuantumCircuit(2, 2)
      qc.h(0)
      qc.cx(0, 1)
      qc.measure(0, 0)
      qc.measure(1, 1)

      # Transpile circuit against fake_nighthawk
      pm = generate_preset_pass_manager(backend=backend, optimization_level=1)
      isa_circuit = pm.run(qc)

      # Run using local simulator
      sampler = Sampler(backend)
      job = sampler.run([isa_circuit])
      result = job.result()

Bug Fixes
---------

- IAM authentification Bugfix when using a proxy configuration specified in ``QiskitRuntimeService``. 
  The patch injects the ``proxies`` and ``verify`` attributes from ``QiskitRuntimeService`` into ``IAMTokenManager`` when using cloud authentification (``CloudAuth``). (`2344 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-ibm-runtime/pull/2344>`__)


Other Notes
-----------

- The deprecated methods ``check_pending_jobs()`` and ``delete_job()`` methods along with 
  support for python 3.9 have been removed. (`2439 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-ibm-runtime/pull/2439>`__)
- Add :class:`CircuitSchedule` as an optional input to :meth:`draw_circuit_schedule_timing`.
  Allows for manual preprocessing of the circuit schedule timing data outside of its draw function. (`2457 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-ibm-runtime/pull/2457>`__)
