0.44.0 (2025-09-23)
===================

Upgrade Notes
-------------

- Fixes inconsistency in unit conversion of ``rep_times`` parameter in :class:`.QasmBackendConfiguration` to maintain
  consistency between initialization and serialization. The parameter is now properly 
  converted from microseconds to seconds during initialization and back to microseconds 
  when serialized through :meth:`to_dict()`, matching the behavior of other timing parameters 
  like ``rep_delay_range`` and ``default_rep_delay``. (`2386 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-ibm-runtime/pull/2386>`__)
- A consistent error will now be raised during service initialization if an invalid API token is given to :class:`.QiskitRuntimeService`. 

  An error will also be raised if a given instance is from a different account than the account associated 
  with the given token. This was the previously documented behavior in the ``0.40.0`` release notes. (`2408 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-ibm-runtime/pull/2408>`__)


New Features
------------

- Since backends now support running jobs that contain both fractional gates and dynamic circuits, control flow 
  instructions are no longer filtered out when using ``use_fractional_gates=True``. As a result, there is a new translation state plugin, 
  :class:`~.IBMDynamicFractionalTranslationPlugin`, for targeting circuits with both 
  dynamic circuits and fractional gates.

  :class:`~.IBMFractionalTranslationPlugin` is deprecated 
  since it is no longer necessary. (`2366 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-ibm-runtime/pull/2366>`__)
