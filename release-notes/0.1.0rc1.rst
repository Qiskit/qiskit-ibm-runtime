0.1.0rc1
========

New Features
------------

-  You can now pass ``instance`` parameter in the hub/group/project
   format to ``qiskit_ibm_runtime.IBMRuntimeService.jobs()`` to filter
   jobs. Currently only supported for legacy authentication.

-  You can now use the
   `qiskit_ibm_runtime.RuntimeJob.interim_results() <https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/0.30/qiskit_ibm_runtime.RuntimeJob#interim_results>`__
   method to retrieve runtime program interim results. Note that interim
   results will only be available for up to two days.

Upgrade Notes
-------------

-  In order to be consistent with other properties in
   `qiskit_ibm_runtime.RuntimeJob <https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/qiskit_ibm_runtime.RuntimeJob>`__
   class the job_id and backend methods have been converted to
   properties.

-  When uploading a program with
   ``qiskit_ibm_runtime.IBMRuntimeService.upload_program()``, the
   program description is now optional.

-  When printing programs with
   ``qiskit_ibm_runtime.IBMRuntimeService.pprint_programs()``,
   ``backend_requirements`` will now be listed.

Bug Fixes
---------

-  Fixed an issue with JSON encoding and decoding when using
   ``ParameterExpression``\ s in conjunction with Qiskit Terra 0.19.1
   and above. Previously, the ``Parameter`` instances reconstructed from
   the JSON output would have different unique identifiers, causing them
   to seem unequal to the input. They will now have the correct backing
   identities.
