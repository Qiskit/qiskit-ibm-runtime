Upgrade Notes
-------------

-  When migrating from ``qiskit-ibmq-provider`` your ``ibm_quantum``
   channel credentials will get automatically copied over from the
   qiskitrc file and a qiskit-ibm.json file will get created if one
   doesnâ€™t exist. You have to just initialize
   `QiskitRuntimeService <https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/qiskit_ibm_runtime.QiskitRuntimeService>`__
   class without passing any parameters to use this copied over default
   ``ibm_quantum`` account.

   Ex:

   .. code:: python

      from qiskit_ibm_runtime import QiskitRuntimeService
      service = QiskitRuntimeService()

-  ``IBMEstimator`` class which was deprecated earlier is now removed.
   Use `Estimator <https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/qiskit_ibm_runtime.Estimator>`__ class going
   forward.

-  ``IBMRuntimeService`` class which was deprecated earlier is now
   removed. Use
   `QiskitRuntimeService <https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/qiskit_ibm_runtime.QiskitRuntimeService>`__
   class going forward.
