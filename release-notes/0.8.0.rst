0.8.0
=====

New Features
------------

-  Python 3.10 is now supported.

-  Advanced resilience options can now be set under
   ``options.resilience``. See
   ``qiskit_ibm_runtime.options.ResilienceOptions``
   for all available options.

-  You can now specify a pair of result decoders for the
   ``result_decoder`` parameter of
   `qiskit_ibm_runtime.QiskitRuntimeService.run() <https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/docs/api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/0.29/qiskit-runtime-service#run>`__
   method. If a pair is specified, the first one is used to decode
   interim results and the second the final results.

Upgrade Notes
-------------

-  The default ``resilience_level`` option for has been changed from 0
   to 1. In addition, the default ``optimization_level`` option has been
   changed from 1 to 3.

Deprecation Notes
-----------------

-  The transpilation options ``translation_method`` and
   ``timing_constraints`` have been deprecated.

Bug Fixes
---------

-  If a
   `qiskit_ibm_runtime.IBMBackend <https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/docs/api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/ibm-backend>`__
   instance is passed to the
   `qiskit_ibm_runtime.Session <https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/docs/api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/session>`__
   constructor, the service used to initialize the ``IBMBackend``
   instance is used for the session instead of the default account
   service.
