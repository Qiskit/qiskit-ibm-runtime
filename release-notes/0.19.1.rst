0.19.1
======

Upgrade Notes
-------------

-  Extend ``DynamicCircuitInstructions.from_backend()`` to extract and
   patch durations from both ``BackendV1`` and ``BackendV2`` objects.
   Also add ``DynamicCircuitInstructions.from_target()`` to use a
   ``Target`` object instead.

Bug Fixes
---------

-  Fix the patching of ``DynamicCircuitInstructions`` for instructions
   with durations that are not in units of ``dt``.

-  Fixed an issue with the ``qpy.dump()`` function, when the
   ``use_symengine`` flag was set to a truthy object that evaluated to
   ``True`` but was not actually the boolean ``True`` the generated QPY
   payload would be corrupt.
