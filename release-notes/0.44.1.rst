0.44.1 (2026-02-12)
===================

Deprecation Notes
-----------------

- Submitting circuits with non-empty ``circuit.calibrations`` is deprecated and will
  be removed in ``qiskit-ibm-runtime`` v0.45. (`2574 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-ibm-runtime/pull/2574>`__)


Bug Fixes
---------

- While creating backend objects, `.QiskitRuntimeService` previously checked for only ``rzz`` 
  gates in the backend's basis gates to decide whether to use cache or create a new backend 
  object. Now `.QiskitRuntimeService` will check for both ``rzz`` and ``rx`` gates in the 
  backend's basis gates to decide whether to refresh the configuration or fetch 
  from cache. (`2524 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-ibm-runtime/pull/2524>`__)
- The initialization of ``QiskitRuntimeService`` no longer fails if it is not
  possible to retrieve the catalog information of an instance (for example, due to the
  instance being archived). (`2603 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-ibm-runtime/pull/2603>`__)
