0.18.0
======

New Features
------------

-  Added a new parameter, dynamic_circuits to
   `backends() <https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/docs/api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/qiskit-runtime-service#backends>`__
   to allow filtering of backends that support dynamic circuits.

-  Added ``max_time`` parameter to ``IBMBackend.open_session()``.

-  Added a method ``RuntimeJob.queue_info()`` to get the queue
   information from the backend. This feature was transferred from
   ``qiskit_ibm_provider``.

Deprecation Notes
-----------------

-  ``QiskitRuntimeService.runtime()`` has been deprecated.

Bug Fixes
---------

-  Many methods in `RuntimeJob <https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/docs/api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/0.41/runtime-job>`__
   require retrieving the job data from the API with ``job_get()``. This
   API call will now exclude the ``params`` field by default because
   they are only necessary in
   `qiskit_ibm_runtime.RuntimeJob.inputs() <https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/docs/api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/0.41/runtime-job#inputs>`__.
