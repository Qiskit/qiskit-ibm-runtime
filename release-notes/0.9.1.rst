0.9.1
=====

Upgrade Notes
-------------

-  `qiskit_ibm_runtime.QiskitRuntimeService.jobs() <https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/qiskit_ibm_runtime.QiskitRuntimeService#jobs>`__
   now has a ``backend_name`` parameter that can be used to only return
   jobs run with the specified backend.

-  Allow the user to store account details in a file specified by the
   user in the parameter. ``filename``. The default remains
   ~/.qiskit/qiskit-ibm.json. Example of usage: Ex:

   .. code:: python

      QiskitRuntimeService.save_account(channel="ibm_quantum",
                                        filename="~/my_account_file.json",
                                        name = "my_account",
                                        token="my_token")
      service = QiskitRuntimeService(channel="ibm_quantum", 
                                     filename="~/my_account_file.json", 
                                     name = "my_account",)

Deprecation Notes
-----------------

-  ``backend`` is no longer a supported option when using
   `qiskit_ibm_runtime.Session.run() <https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/0.29/qiskit_ibm_runtime.Session#run>`__.
   Sessions do not support multiple cross backends. Additionally, an
   exception will be raised if a backend passed in through options does
   not match the original session backend in an active session.

Bug Fixes
---------

-  ``ECRGate`` and ``CZGate`` mappings have been added to the ``Target``
   constructor to fix a tranpile bug.

Other Notes
-----------

-  Since error messages from a failing job may be long, we shortened
   them so that they begin from the last ``Traceback`` in the message.
