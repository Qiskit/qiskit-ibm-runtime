0.17.0
======

New Features
------------

-  Added a new method
   `properties() <https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/qiskit_ibm_runtime.RuntimeJob#properties>`__ which
   returns the backend properties of the job at the time the job was
   run.

-  `details() <https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/qiskit_ibm_runtime.Session#details>`__ has a new
   field, activated_at, which is the timestamp of when the session was
   changed to active.

Bug Fixes
---------

-  When a single backend is retrieved with the ``instance`` parameter,

   .. code:: python

      service.backend('ibm_torino', instance='ibm-q/open/main')
      # raises error if torino is not in ibm-q/open/main but in a different instance
      # the user has access to
      service = QiskitRuntimeService(channel="ibm_quantum", instance="ibm-q/open/main")
      service.backend('ibm_torino') # raises the same error

   if the backend is not in the instance but in a different one the user
   has access to, an error will be raised. The same error will now be
   raised if an instance is passed in at initialization and then a
   backend not in that instance is retrieved.

-  Fixed an issue where retrieving the coupling_map of some backends
   would result in a NameError.
