0.36.0 (2025-02-14)
===================

Upgrade Notes
-------------

- The minimal required ``qiskit`` version is now 1.3.  
  Qiskit 1.3 introduces a new QPY version 13. This new format version offers better features and the
  minimum required version of Qiskit was raised to start leveraging it for serializing circuits in job
  submissions. (`2096 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-ibm-runtime/pull/2096>`__)


Other Notes
-----------

- The following outdated deprecations have been removed: 

      - Support for the simulator option ``noise_model`` on cloud simulators has been removed. 
        This option will still work in the local testing mode. 

      - The ``NoiseLearnerResult`` properties ``generators`` and ``rates`` have been removed. They 
        can still be accessed in the ``error`` property.

      - The utility function ``get_runtime_api_base_url()`` has been removed. (`2124 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-ibm-runtime/pull/2124>`__)
