0.36.0 (2025-02-14)
===================

Upgrade Notes
-------------

- The minimal required ``qiskit`` version is now 1.3.  
  Qiskit 1.3 introduces QPY version 13. The minimum required Qiskit version was raised so Qiskit Runtime could use the latest QPY version 
  for serializing circuits in job
  submissions. (`2096 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-ibm-runtime/pull/2096>`__)


Other Notes
-----------

- The following outdated deprecations have been removed: 

      - Support for the simulator option ``noise_model`` on cloud simulators has been removed. 
        This option will still work in local testing mode. 

      - The ``NoiseLearnerResult`` properties ``generators`` and ``rates`` have been removed. They 
        can still be accessed in the ``error`` property.

      - The utility function ``get_runtime_api_base_url()`` has been removed. (`2124 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-ibm-runtime/pull/2124>`__)
